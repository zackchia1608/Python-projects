The app aims to provide thought of the day based on natural philosophies such as Buddhism and Stoicism. As a start, everyday, the app will allow the user to write one sentence against a prompt on certain topics. The app will then assess if the user is more in line with Buddhist or Stoic philosophies, and in return decide to return either Buddhist advice or Stoic advice based on the prompt written.\n",

They only text my mother now and not me. Feeling lonely and I nobody to talk to and my grandmother who used to be my best friend suddenly start gaslighting me starting 2 or so years ago. Ever since I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder people stop reaching out as soon as I got better  and started taking my meds like I should and right around the time I try to get my own money, health insurance and do things on my own my family doesn't want to help, they just get my hopes up only for them to lie again and again.

The more i got to know her the more i fell in love with her. I became more nervous around her and my mind started to be flooded by thoughts of her to the point of starting to get desperate. \\n\\nAfter putting some distance, i see that what i was doing was wrong and honestly i feel like an idiot. One of the reasons i liked her so much is because it has been so long since i actually met someone i genuinely like that i disregarded every thing that was telling me to stop thinking about her in that light. However, even after all of this we are still close and i fell like a really want to be there as her friend, without hoping for anything. It is  pretty damn hard but i think i really want to give it a shot.\\n\\nI want to move on and  refocus on my own self growth, but i'm really straggling  to do so.

All of my friends moved away from here after university except this one girl I have been friends with since high school since we started hanging out again I have developed feelings for her. problem is she has a boyfriend, he’s not a bad guy but their relationship is clearly failing he moved 2hrs away to the boonies away just get away from civilization he owes her thousands of dollars from when he was unemployed and since he got a job he spends most of his extra money on lottery tickets and Pokémon cards she has also told me they haven’t had sex in over a month the problem is they haven’t broken up yet. he has gotten upset at the amount of time we were spending together and since she is the only friend I can actually see, it’s been difficult. I’m not sure what if anything I can do. I know I’m supposed to focus on things I can control, but between the physical and emotional pain I feel myself becoming more depressed.</td>\n",

       "126   So this February i met a girl with whom i felt a connection i've never felt before. I was ready to pursue her romantically, but after 3 weeks she told me she was a lesbian. I was super down but i decided to stick around because i thought 'ok she is not into me, and she never will, but I just like her so much as a person , i think we could be friends or something else'  \\n\\nThis was a dumb decision because even though  i told myself that i just wanted to be her friend, i really was just hoping for something to happen. The more i got to know her the more i fell in love with her. I became more nervous around her and my mind started to be flooded by thoughts of her to the point of starting to get desperate. \\n\\nAfter putting some distance, i see that what i was doing was wrong and honestly i feel like an idiot. One of the reasons i liked her so much is because it has been so long since i actually met someone i genuinely like that i disregarded every thing that was telling me to stop thinking about her in that light. However, even after all of this we are still close and i fell like a really want to be there as her friend, without hoping for anything. It is  pretty damn hard but i think i really want to give it a shot.\\n\\nI want to move on and  refocus on my own self growth, but i'm really straggling  to do so. What stoic principles can i use to refocus on myself and start moving forward? What should i tell myself?   \n",
       "6819                     How do you, as a stoic, deal when someone you love keeps on doing something that deeply upsets you?\\n\\nMy SO has depression and anxiety and there are good weeks and then there are bad weeks. SO refused to let me know what was actually bothering her/him to the point she/he made a request to not talk for 1 week and that just infuriated me.\\n\\nHer/His reason for not telling me this is because I have a very high stress job and he/she didn't want to add on to my \"stress.\" It's not because I complain about my job (I voice out my problems from time to time) that makes her/him think it's high stress. It's because I work for a public official.\\n\\nI'm really patient when it comes to him/her but keeping her/his issue a secret for weeks until it blew up in my face just made me extremely upset and made me say some things that hurt. Her/His request wouldn't have infuriated me if he/she would would have voiced out the issues first.\\n\\nWe had fights like this before wherein it blew up in my face but this is the first time I said hurtful things. I try to apply stoicism to every aspect of my life but her/his request just made me forget stoicism.\\n\\nI would appreciate any feedback on your experiences in dealing with similar issues.\\n\\nJust to be clear: WHAT INFURIATED ME WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE/HE HAS DEPRESSION ANXIETY IT WAS BECAUSE HE/SHE CHOSE TO KEEP THE BAD WEEKS A SECRET FROM ME UNTIL IT BLEW UP IN MY FACE.   \n",

       "872   If you pick up a puzzle piece and it doesn't fit were you thought, it's not a bad piece. It was a bad guess on our part. It's us, always 100% us.\\n\\nOther people are never wrong. Of course we try to improve things going forward but the present is exactly what it is.\\n\\nWe're not ever really wrong, either. The fault may be in our own judgement, but it is natural and normal for us to find our way as best we can through uncertainty. Our best guess is always the right play. We are responsible in the practical sense but we are no more to blame than anyone else. \\n\\nI'm not suggesting that we withhold judgement of others and ourselves; judgement is fine,. I'm saying that blame is meaningless here, it's like blaming the moon for being round, it's ridiculous, conceptually incoherent. Others simply are what they are, despite our imaginings. We simply are what we are, despite our imaginings. \\n\\nOf course we desire to improve, and our noble expectations of ourselves are our guides going forward, they are not the present truth. If they are well-selected guides, we'd rightly expect to sometimes fall short and be corrected by them. It is admirable to aim high, admirable to be corrected and to adapt ourselves to it. In fact, this is arguably the only meaningful measure of progress.   \n",

Whilst carrying the weight of the world, Atlas(supposedly) pleaded to Zeus: \"I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders.\" The quote has also been cited as a Jewish proverb, so the true origin is foggy.\\n\\nIn my opinion the origin doesn't completely matter; the essence remains the same. In life the weight of your duties and struggles is typically out of your control, therefore there is only one element that you can control to fix an overbearing burden; it is you. However lets say you *could* change the weight. Would it not still be better to rise above the challenge?\\n\\nThe quote embodies this.   \n",

I just so happened to be born in the place that I did, my thoughts and opinions have been determined as a result of genetics and externals. \\n\\nWhen I think about this, it does not feel like there is a \"me\", I'm just a body and brain being subjected to the world, my decisions and reactions have become predictable. I am just a biological machine, I will react how I was always going to react since the beginning of time. There is no \"me\".\\n\\nNothing is in my control, thoughts and worldviews are determined by experiences and we know that subconscious plays a part before you consciously make a decision, so not even your thoughts and actions are your own, they are the result of biochemistry. The self is an illusion created by the brain because we happened to evolve in a certain way to allow that.   \n",

Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if you go on shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual attention ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to call on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep. So it is with life. **If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are given a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain calls, you must run to the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But if you are old, never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called, you should be unable to come in time.**\\n\\nWhat exactly is meant here?   \n",

    "1. Both subreddits have people who are seeking clarifications on the different philosophies tenets. One insight we could glean is that Buddhism and Stoic users are more intellectually curious in nature and could be a target demographic in our marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Users of the subreddits both gravitate to Buddhism or Stoicism to seek help and other user's perspectives on problems. This is a useful insight as it shows a potential target audience for our mental health and wellness app as users seek Buddhist or Stoicism advice to overcome life's challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Differences </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Buddhism reddit users seems to question more about religion and their philosophical tenets more than Stoicism reddit users. This could show that people who gravitate to Buddhism are more questioning in nature compared to Stoic users. We could use this as a key distinguishing factor to determine the type of prompts returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Buddhism reddit users gravitate towards meditation and rituals, while stoicism reddit users are focused more on positive thinking, and control. This could be a distinguishing factor when looking at keywords. So when a user's prompt leans towards positive thinking and control, the app will provide stoicism prompts while if a user references religion, it can return Buddhism prompts instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Buddhism reddit users also seem to be less verbose compared to Stoicism reddit users looking at the message length and context of the post. Hence, message length could also be a distinguishing feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Buddhism reddit users seems to be more outward looking and would think about things in a bigger perspective. In contrast, the posts from stoicism seems to have more introspective look at life with a focus on one's own circumstances."

    "## Limitations to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data is only being scraped from reddit who may not represent the entire view of Buddhism or Stoicism. Hence, data might be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The modelling parameters could be better tuned if there were better processing power and time available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model accuracies are within standard deviation of each other. So it is hard to determine at this point which is better. We will probably need to better test the accuracy of our model once our app is beta tested.\n"
